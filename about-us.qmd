Are we a lab or are we a studio? Are we scientists or artists? Why do we have to choose just one box? Let's break down this false binary: we're both! We work with data. We create art. Meet our contributors, statisticians, data scientists, dancers, illustrators . . . Interdisciplinary team work makes the dream work.

| ![](images/alex-profile.jpg){width="600"}    | Alexander Brandfonbrener is a English and Statistics Major at Amherst College, entering his junior year. He spends his free time on campus working as an editor for The Student and writing a graphic novel. He was drawn to this project because it exemplifies an intersection between statistics and visual art, and because racism in medicine is such an impactful issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![](images/gillian-profile.jpg){width="600"} | Gillian Richard is a sophomore Economics major at Amherst College. On campus, she is involved in the Intersections dance group and the Sailing Team as well as being a TA for the Theater and Dance Department. She also currently teaches for Charleston Academy of Musical Theatre and has performed in about 40 shows over the past 15 years including being the dance captain for multiple professional shows with Charleston Stage.

| ![](images/joy-profile.jpg)                  | Joy Won is an Education Studies Major at Amherst College interested in the intersections between art and statistics. At home she proudly acts as a cat butler and on campus can be seen val-sitting with a cup of tea or doing some last minute reading at level C of Frost. She was interested in joining the Correia lab to explore how data art can be a medium by which statisticians can portray data to fight against structural racism specifically in the context of medical disparities.                                                                                                     |
| ![](images/tracy-profile.jpg){width="300"}   | Tracy Huang is a Statistics and Psychology Major at Amherst College. On campus, she sings in the Women's Chorus and enjoys spending free time reading and doing crafts such as cross-stitch. She was drawn to the project because of the opportunity to not only delve into the data of racial disparities in obstetrics/gynecology, but to use that data and translate it into artistic pieces that combine her love of statistics and art.                                                                                                                                                          |
