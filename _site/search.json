    "text": "Review Process\nFollowing the PROSPERO and PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews, we developed a review protocol that defined our review question, search criteria, data extraction process, and strategy for data synthesis. We searched the the top eight journals in obstetrics and gynecology as ranked by the Scimago Journal Ranking system: Human Reproduction Update, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Human Reproduction, Fertility & Sterility, BJOG: an International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, and Gynecologic Oncology. We searched these journals in the PubMed database for articles published between January 1, 2010 and June 10, 2021 using the terms \"racial disparit*\" , \"racial bias\" , \"racism\" , \"discrimination\" , \"minorit*\" , among other terms related to the subject area. \nWe included prospective observational cohort studies, retrospective observational cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized controlled trials, and registry studies. Qualitative studies, reviews with no new data, case reports, and studies outside the United States were excluded. \nOver 750 articles were identified from our initial search. Each article was randomly assigned to two independent reviewers, and each reviewer assessed the article's relevance and eligiblity for our review based on the abstract. Discrepancies regarding eligibility were solved through discussion between the reviewers. After screening, 251 articles were identified as eligible for inclusion and systematically reviewed. Each eligible article was again randomly assigned to two independent reviewers, with discrepancies being resolved through discussion.\nA data extraction spreadsheet was created for each reviewer to systematically and independently enter data from the eligible articles using Google forms.  The spreadsheet recorded quality assessment of the articles, using modified questions from the modified versions of the NIH Quality Assessment tool checklist and the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool checklist. Other information recorded in the spreadsheet included: doi, research aim, study location, study type, study end and start date, data source, themes addressed ( access-to-care, care provided, and/or health outcomes), sample sizes for each race or ethnicity category, statistical model information (stratification or subanalysis, outcome measure, reference group, covariates), and model effect estimates for each comparison."

She also currently teaches for Charleston Academy of Musical Theatre and has performed in about 40 shows over the past 15 years including being the dance captain for multiple professional shows with Charleston Stage. She was drawn to this project due to the possibility of combining dance and data as well as her interest in gynecological research and reproductive justice.\n\n\n\nJoy Won is an Education Studies Major at Amherst College interested in the intersections between art and statistics. At home she proudly acts as a cat butler and on campus can be seen val-sitting with a cup of tea or doing some last minute reading at level C of Frost. She was interested in joining the Correia lab to explore how data art can be a medium by which statisticians can portray data to fight against structural racism specifically in the context of medical disparities.\n\n\n\nTracy Huang is a Statistics and Psychology Major at Amherst College. On campus, she sings in the Women’s Chorus and enjoys spending free time reading and doing crafts such as cross-stitch. She was drawn to the project because of the opportunity to not only delve into the data of racial disparities in obstetrics/gynecology, but to use that data and translate it into artistic pieces that combine her love of statistics and art."

    "text": "This movement piece focuses on the centering of whiteness as the “norm” in medical research through the use of white as the reference group. The duration of the piece represents the percentage of articles identified in our review that use white as the reference group. I also represent the percentages of articles that cover three different themes: access to care, treatment received, and health outcome through the progression of body parts used. This shows that the majority of pieces focus on health outcomes rather than the other two themes. Focusing on the end result rather than the process re-emphasizes the role of whiteness that ignores the racism along the process that may lead to differing health outcomes. I also connected the theme of this piece to similar movements in the dance and music world through the use of a balletic style of dance (ballet has been traditionally viewed as the basis for all other dance which ignores the role of the Africanist presence in dance) and a score from composer Florence Price. Price is recognized as the first African-American symphonic composer. Lastly, the piece was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina, which connects to the horrific beginning of gynecology in the South with J. Marion Sims working on plantations and taking advantage of Black women. This piece strives to connect the centering of whiteness in gynecological research, dance, and music to emphasize the role of white supremacy in systematic racism.\nFor More Information: Medical Bondage by Deirdre Cooper Owens, Digging the Africanist Presence in American Performance: Dance and Other Contexts by Brenda D.

    "text": "Trees:Forest by Joy Won\n\n\nThe well-known idiom, “Don’t See the Forest for the Trees,” was a key quote in thinking about the obstetrics and gynecology data we worked with this past summer in the Correia lab. Our research consisted of collecting and analyzing data about racial disparities relating to access to care, treatment received, and health outcomes from top journals in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Data is concrete, numbers on a screen without emotion or feeling, but the subject matter of the data we collected was and is not. When working with medical data, especially relating to disparities and health outcomes, it is essential to approach the work with sensitivity and respect for those who have made this work possible. With that in mind, data art was the focus of our SURF project this summer, and as a group we pondered, researched, and discussed how the art we produced, in whatever form it took, could contribute to the greater narrative of our research.\nThe artwork above is titled, “Trees:Forest.” In creating this image, I thought a lot about how to represent the vast quantity of the data we collected and processed, while not losing sight of each individual person or patient, or metaphorical “tree”, from who the data was collected about. Only through the presence of each tree as a collective forest can we analyze the data and see the trends and connections between different groups, variables, etc.\nThis was more specifically represented by the cubic landscape seen in the background depicting a forest, with a single tree from the forest being at the forefront of the image. In thinking about the Groundwater Approach, I combined the river of the landscape with the trunk of the tree to show how the water each tree receives is essential to its growth and life, which metaphorically represents the varying distributions of resources people have access to. However, the problem at hand would be the stark differences between different racial groups being due to the racial structures in our society, the river, disproportionately waters and provides resources like education, medical care, and more.\nFinally, the water bubbles outward to a waterfall located at the corner of the landscape. The streams of water mesh into the roots of the tree to represent the networks, connections, and experiences that shape and help the tree to grow. Through this visualization, I hope it is evident that we as individuals, the trees, we must collectively see, understand, and work against racial structures in our society, the forest, to work towards a more equitable future.\nFor more information on the Groundwater Approach please visit: https://www.racialequityinstitute.com/groundwaterapproach\nHayes-Greene, Deena, and Bayard P.

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the things that struck me during our review was just how many different studies identified large racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality outcomes AFTER accounting for many different “explanations” – differences in age, income, education, hospital type, geography – and measured in many different ways – blood transfusions, hysterectomy, sepsis, admission to intensive care unit, . . .\nIn this piece, each circle represents an estimated risk ratio for the risk of a maternal morbidity and mortality outcome; the shading around the circle represents uncertainty around that estimate. As each article we reviewed used “white” (or “White” or “Non-Hispanic White”) as the reference group, the white circle in the middle represents the risk in the referent group. The radius of each of the other circles is relative to the increased risk among other race and ethnicity groups – the larger the circle, the larger the risk. The circles that are blurred represent groups that were either of “Missing/Unknown” race and ethnicity or “Other” race and ethnicity; the blur suggests we need to refocus our microscope to get a clearer picture of the people in these groups.\nWhy the microscope reference? For this piece, I drew upon the imagery of a blastocyst. By the 5th or 6th day after fertilization, an embryo is in the blastocyst stage (a rapidly dividing ball of cells). In the data art, each circle represents evidence of an inequity and together the circles accumulate and speak to the volume of evidence that may seem inconceivable, yet is undeniable."

Our SURF group talked a lot about this metaphor, and the imagery of groundwater was in my mind while creating this piece.\nIn a 2021 article published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology titled “Urban-rural differences in pregnancy-related deaths, United States, 2011-2016”, researchers “sought to compare pregnancy-related mortality across and within urban and rural counties by race and ethnicity and age”. The following table is presented in the article:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this animated data art piece, each confidence interval in Table 3 is represented as a line of water dripping deeper and deeper into the ground. Different colors are used to distinguish the different race and ethnicity groups, ordered by lowest to highest risk. A few notable observations:\n\nwithin each race and ethnicity group, pregnancy-related deaths increase the more rural a county is\nwithin each urban-rural categorization, pregnancy-related deaths are lowest among “White” or “Hispanic” and highest among “Black” mothers\nthere is substantial uncertainty around some of the estimates, particularly for the “American Indian or Alaska Native” group\n\nMost notably, the highest PRMR among “White” mothers (19.7 deaths per 100,000 births, 95% CI: 16.9 - 22.8, in the most rural counties) is much lower than the lowest PRMR among “Black” mothers (36.7 deaths per 100,000 births, 95% CI: 34.3 - 39.3, in the most urban counties)."

For the first few weeks, I tried to make generic representations of data with a focus on the data type. For example, I did tests with digital values as colors, and ratios as fluid gradients. Then for the rest of the project, I tailored my work to creating a narrative using imagery connected to OB/GYN topics. This included cervixes and other reproductive organs, and an extended metaphor that tied groundwater to racial inequities, as per the Racial Equity Institute’s publication. I settled on hearts as the medium for my main data art piece.\nGillian Richard ’24: I began by practicing how to represent numbers through movement including the use of levels, body parts, intensity, location, style, repetition, and direction. I then moved into using some example articles to practice representing actual data and created four practice videos, each with a different way of embodying the data. I created a list of steps for my process that is as follows:\nMethod:\n\nRead through article\nRecord data\nCalculate differences\nMeditate on connection between subject + medium\nAssign data to body parts/duration/etc\nImprov for each statistic\nChoreograph and record\n\nSince I am using my own body as the vessel to present the data, I found it important to focus on the prevalence of whiteness and white supremacy due to my positionality as a white woman. Therefore, for my final piece, I represented the percentage of articles that used white as a reference group."
