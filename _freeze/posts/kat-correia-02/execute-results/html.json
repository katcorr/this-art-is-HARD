Our SURF group talked a lot about this metaphor, and the imagery of groundwater was in my mind while creating this piece.\n\nIn a 2021 article published in the *American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology* titled \"[Urban-rural differences in pregnancy-related deaths, United States, 2011-2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640361/)\", researchers \"sought to compare pregnancy-related mortality across and within urban and rural counties by race and ethnicity and age\". The following table is presented in the article:\n\n![](images/table3.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1700\" fig-alt=\"A table from the journal article dislaying the pregnancy-related mortality ratio by county urban-rural categorization, overall and by race and ethnicity, in the United States from 2011-2016.\"}\n\nIn this animated data art piece, each confidence interval in Table 3 is represented as a line of water dripping deeper and deeper into the ground. Different colors are used to distinguish the different race and ethnicity groups, ordered by lowest to highest risk.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![](images/groundwater_legend.png){fig-alt=\"A legend indicating leftmost water lines represent more urban counties and rightmost water lines represent more rural counties.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1900\"}\n\nIf we think how a more typical data visualization might present the data in Table 3, we might imagine something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![](images/groundwater_typical.png){fig-alt=\"Plot displaying the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 births for each race and ethnicity group and each urban-rural categorization. White and Hispanic have the lowest point estimates and shortest confidence intervals. American Indian or Alaska Native and Black have the highest point estimates and the widest confidence intervals.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"1900\"}\n\nA few notable observations:\n\n-   within each race and ethnicity group, pregnancy-related deaths increase the more rural a county is\n\n-   within each urban-rural categorization, pregnancy-related deaths are lowest among \"White\" or \"Hispanic\" and highest among \"Black\" mothers\n\n-   there is substantial uncertainty around some of the estimates, particularly for the \"American Indian or Alaska Native\" group\n\nMost notably, the highest pregnancy-related mortality ratio among \"White\" mothers (19.7 deaths per 100,000 births, 95% CI: 16.9 - 22.8, in the most rural counties) is much lower than the lowest pregnancy-related mortality ratio among \"Black\" mothers (36.7 deaths per 100,000 births, 95% CI: 34.3 - 39.3, in the most urban counties).\n\nIn the data art piece, the y-axis is flipped such that the higher the pregnancy-related mortality, the deeper the water line seeps into the ground. \n",
