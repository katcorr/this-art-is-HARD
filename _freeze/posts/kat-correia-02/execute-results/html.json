Our SURF group talked a lot about this metaphor, and the imagery of groundwater was in my mind while creating this piece.\n\nIn a 2021 article published in the *American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology* titled \"[Urban-rural differences in pregnancy-related deaths, United States, 2011-2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33640361/)\", researchers \"sought to compare pregnancy-related mortality across and within urban and rural counties by race and ethnicity and age\". The following table is presented in the article:\n\n![](images/table3.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nIn this animated data art piece, each confidence interval in Table 3 is represented as a line of water dripping deeper and deeper into the ground. Different colors are used to distinguish the different race and ethnicity groups, ordered by lowest to highest risk. A few notable observations:\n\n-   within each race and ethnicity group, pregnancy-related deaths increase the more rural a county is\n\n-   within each urban-rural categorization, pregnancy-related deaths are lowest among \"White\" or \"Hispanic\" and highest among \"Black\" mothers\n\n-   there is substantial uncertainty around some of the estimates, particularly for the \"American Indian or Alaska Native\" group\n\nMost notably, the highest PRMR among \"White\" mothers (19.7 deaths per 100,000 births, 95% CI: 16.9 - 22.8, in the most rural counties) is much lower than the lowest PRMR among \"Black\" mothers (36.7 deaths per 100,000 births, 95% CI: 34.3 - 39.3, in the most urban counties).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
