As each article we reviewed used \"white\" (or \"White\" or \"Non-Hispanic White\") as the reference group, the white circle in the middle represents the risk in the referent group. The radius of each of the other circles is relative to the increased risk among other race and ethnicity groups -- the larger the circle, the larger the risk. The circles that are blurred represent groups that were either of \"Missing/Unknown\" race and ethnicity or \"Other\" race and ethnicity; the blur suggests we need to refocus our microscope to get a clearer picture of the people in these groups.\n\nWhy the microscope reference? For this piece, I drew upon the imagery of a blastocyst. By the 5th or 6th day after fertilization, an embryo is in the blastocyst stage (a rapidly dividing ball of cells). In the data art, each circle represents evidence of an inequity and together the circles accumulate and speak to the volume of evidence that may seem inconceivable, yet is undeniable.\n\n[![](images/embryo-day.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}](https://www.utahfertility.com/understanding-embryo-grading/)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
